## OpenEMP

OpenEMP is an Open source Education Management Platform for Schools, Universities and any type of educational institution. Designed to assist administrators, students, and instructors, to easily manage their respective workflow.

We at OpenEMP believe that an education management system is a key factor to enhance the learning & teaching experience, making this the main tool to help all educational staff to collaborate and coordinate, ultimately improving the education quality of institutions. 

OpenEMP is developed by a community of tech enthusiasts who are passionate about improving the educational system. 

If you also believe in the cause of improving education for all, and would like to contribute to this project by donations, development consultancy, or even your personal advice from an education or tech perspective, do reach out to us at contact@openemp.org we would love to hear from you!
